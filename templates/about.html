      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        RadioResident was created to bridge the gap between voluminous textbooks
        and the focused, exam-oriented content radiology residents actually need.
        We curate bite-sized notes, illustrative diagrams, mnemonics, and past-paper
        question banks so that you spend less time searching and more time mastering the material.

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2025 by <strong>Dr. Shashikant Morale</strong>, a practicing radiologist and
        passionate educator, RadioResident started as a set of handwritten
        “system-wise” guides for colleagues preparing for DNB and FRCR exams.
        Over time, those notes evolved into an online platform open to residents
        worldwide.
