1.Describe briefly the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Embolism. Give in detail the imaging modalities for diagnosis of this entity and their relative merits and demerits. [JAN 97]

Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by the obstruction of one or more pulmonary arteries by thrombotic material, typically originating from deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities. The pathophysiology of PE involves a complex interplay of factors leading to the formation and dislodgment of thrombi, their migration to the pulmonary circulation, and subsequent obstruction of pulmonary vessels.

Pathophysiology:

1. Thrombus Formation: PE often originates from DVT, where blood clot formation occurs in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis. Various factors contribute to thrombus formation, including Virchow's triad - endothelial injury, stasis of blood flow, and hypercoagulability of blood.

2. Thrombus Dislodgment: The thrombi in the deep veins can dislodge and enter the venous circulation.

3. Migration: These emboli travel through the right side of the heart and enter the pulmonary arteries.

4. Obstruction: As emboli become lodged in the pulmonary vasculature, they obstruct blood flow, causing a ventilation-perfusion mismatch and ultimately leading to impaired gas exchange and hemodynamic instability.

Imaging Modalities for Diagnosis:

1. Chest X-ray (CXR):

- Merits: CXR is readily available and can provide useful information such as atelectasis, pleural effusion, and cardiomegaly. It may show indirect signs of PE, but it is not a definitive diagnostic tool.

- Demerits: It lacks sensitivity and specificity for detecting small or subsegmental emboli.

2. Ventilation-Perfusion (V/Q) Scan:

- Merits: V/Q scanning is a nuclear medicine technique that can identify regions of the lung with impaired ventilation and perfusion. It can be useful when other modalities are inconclusive.

- Demerits: It has limitations in obese patients and can yield inconclusive results in certain cases.

3. CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA):

- Merits: CTPA is considered the gold standard for diagnosing PE due to its high sensitivity and specificity. It provides detailed anatomical information and can visualize emboli in the pulmonary arteries.

- Demerits: It requires intravenous contrast, which can be contraindicated in some patients (e.g., those with renal insufficiency or allergies). Radiation exposure is also a concern, especially in young patients.

4. Pulmonary Angiography:

- Merits: Pulmonary angiography is highly accurate and allows for therapeutic interventions such as thrombolysis or embolectomy during the procedure.

- Demerits: It is invasive and carries risks of complications. It is typically reserved for cases where other imaging modalities are inconclusive or when interventional therapy is planned.

In summary, PE is a critical condition resulting from the migration of thrombi to the pulmonary vasculature, leading to obstruction of pulmonary arteries and impaired gas exchange. The choice of imaging modality depends on the clinical scenario, but CTPA is the preferred method due to its high diagnostic accuracy, with the caveat of potential contraindications and radiation exposure. Other modalities like CXR and V/Q scanning have their roles but are less definitive in diagnosing PE. Pulmonary angiography is reserved for specific cases requiring intervention.

2.Wegnerâ€˜s granulomatosis [JAN 97, JUN 07]

Wegener's granulomatosis, now referred to as Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA), is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by systemic necrotizing vasculitis, often involving the upper and lower respiratory tracts and kidneys. The pathogenesis of GPA involves autoimmune inflammation of small- to medium-sized blood vessels, which leads to granuloma formation and tissue damage. The imaging findings in GPA can vary depending on the affected organs:

- Chest Radiography: On chest X-rays, GPA can manifest as multiple nodules or masses with cavitation. These findings are often seen in the lung fields and may mimic lung malignancies.

- CT Imaging: CT scans of the chest are essential for evaluating the extent of pulmonary involvement. They can reveal nodules, cavities, ground-glass opacities, and consolidations. Additionally, sinus involvement, such as sinus opacification or destruction of nasal septum (saddle-nose deformity), may be observed.

- PET-CT: Positron Emission Tomography combined with CT can help differentiate between active inflammation and fibrotic changes. It is useful for assessing the response to treatment.

- Renal Imaging: GPA can lead to glomerulonephritis. Renal ultrasound or CT scans can detect kidney abnormalities such as renal masses, hydronephrosis, or scarring.

3.Pathogenesis and imaging of pulmonary sequestration. [JAN 97, DEC 02, JUN 06, 10]

Pulmonary sequestration is a congenital abnormality in which a portion of lung tissue does not communicate with the tracheobronchial tree and receives its blood supply from systemic arteries. The pathogenesis involves the failure of embryonic lung tissue to separate from the foregut. Imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of pulmonary sequestration:

- CT Angiography: This is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating pulmonary sequestration. It can identify the abnormal blood supply (usually from the aorta or its branches) to the sequestered lung tissue and delineate the vascular anatomy.

- Chest X-ray: In some cases, chest X-rays may show non-specific findings such as an opacity in the lung field. However, it is not specific enough for definitive diagnosis.

- MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging can be used as an alternative to CT, especially in cases where radiation exposure needs to be minimized, such as in pregnant patients or young children.

4.Role of imaging in bronchogenic carcinoma. [JUL 97]

Imaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and staging of bronchogenic carcinoma, a common type of lung cancer. The pathogenesis of bronchogenic carcinoma is primarily related to the exposure to carcinogens, such as smoking. Imaging modalities and their roles include:

- Chest X-ray: Often the initial study performed when evaluating lung cancer, it can reveal masses, nodules, pleural effusions, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

- CT Imaging: High-resolution CT is the gold standard for assessing the size, location, and extent of lung tumors. It provides detailed information about lymph node involvement and the presence of distant metastases.

- PET-CT: Positron Emission Tomography combined with CT helps in identifying metabolically active lesions, assessing regional lymph nodes, and staging the disease.

- MRI and Brain Imaging: Brain MRI is crucial for detecting brain metastases, a common site for spread in lung cancer.

5.Discuss in brief the differential diagnosis of mediastinal masses and their radiological appearances.

Mediastinal masses can originate from various structures within the mediastinum. Their differential diagnosis includes:

Imaging characteristics, along with clinical history and laboratory findings, help differentiate between these entities. CT and MRI are valuable tools for characterizing mediastinal masses, determining their origin, and guiding further management. Biopsy or surgical excision may be necessary for definitive diagnosis in some cases.

6. Alveolar Proteinosis. [98]

Alveolar Proteinosis is a rare lung disorder characterized by the accumulation of a lipoproteinaceous material within the alveoli, leading to impaired gas exchange and respiratory symptoms. The pathogenesis of Alveolar Proteinosis involves a disruption in the clearance of surfactant by alveolar macrophages. Imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis:

- Chest X-ray: Typically shows bilateral, symmetric, hazy opacities often referred to as "crazy paving" pattern. This pattern results from the accumulation of proteinaceous material within the alveoli.

- High-Resolution CT (HRCT): Provides a more detailed evaluation, revealing the "crazy paving" pattern more clearly and sometimes ground-glass opacities. HRCT can also identify the extent of lung involvement.

- Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL): This is an essential diagnostic tool. Analysis of lavage fluid demonstrates milky, opaque fluid with a high concentration of lipids and proteins.

15. Differentiating Features of Intra and Extralobar Sequestration of Lung:

Intralobar and extralobar sequestration are congenital lung malformations where a segment of lung tissue lacks normal communication with the bronchial tree and has its blood supply from systemic arteries. They can be differentiated by:

- Intralobar Sequestration: Typically occurs within the normal lung parenchyma, often in the lower lobes. It shares a pleural covering with the adjacent lung and is susceptible to infections due to communication with the bronchial tree.

- Extralobar Sequestration: Located outside the normal lung and is covered by a separate pleural layer. It usually has its own blood supply from systemic arteries and does not communicate with the bronchial tree.

Imaging modalities like CT angiography help distinguish between the two types, which is important for surgical planning.

- Neurological Abnormalities: Imaging, such as MRI of the brain, may reveal neurological abnormalities associated with the syndrome.

- Muscle Changes: Muscle imaging studies could show changes if neuromuscular involvement is present.

86. Sarcoidosis: Definition, Stages, and Radiological Manifestations (2+2+6 marks):

Definition (2 marks):

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown cause characterized by the formation of non-caseating granulomas in various organs, most commonly affecting the lungs.

Stages (2 marks):

Sarcoidosis can progress through various stages:

1. Stage I: Presence of hilar lymphadenopathy without lung parenchymal involvement.

2. Stage II: In addition to hilar lymphadenopathy, there

is lung parenchymal involvement.

3. Stage III: Parenchymal involvement without hilar lymphadenopathy.

4. Stage IV: Advanced fibrotic changes with lung parenchymal scarring.

Radiological Manifestations (6 marks):

Radiological findings in thoracic sarcoidosis may include:

- Bilateral Hilar Lymphadenopathy (Hilar Adenopathy): Enlarged lymph nodes at the lung hilum, a hallmark of stage I sarcoidosis.

- Pulmonary Infiltrates: In stage II, there can be parenchymal opacities, often in a perilymphatic distribution.

- Reticular or Nodular Opacities: In advanced stages, reticular opacities, and nodules may develop.

- Honeycombing: Seen in some cases with advanced fibrotic changes (stage IV).

- Pleural Disease: Pleural effusions or thickening may occur, albeit less frequently.

- Cavitation: Rarely, cavities may form within granulomas, mimicking other diseases like tuberculosis.

87. Extramedullary Hematopoiesis (EMH): Definition, Causes, and Imaging Findings (2+2+3+3 marks):

Definition (2 marks):

Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) is a compensatory process where blood cell production occurs outside the bone marrow, usually in response to bone marrow failure or chronic anemia.

Causes (2 marks):

EMH can be caused by conditions such as:

1. Myeloproliferative Disorders: Like myelofibrosis.

2. Hemolytic Anemias: Conditions that increase the destruction of red blood cells.

3. Hematological Malignancies: Infiltration of bone marrow by malignant cells.

Imaging Findings (3+3 marks):

Imaging, such as plain film and cross-sectional studies, can reveal EMH-related findings:

- Plain Film (X-ray): May show radiopaque masses with a "doughnut" or "target" appearance due to central necrosis and peripheral active hematopoiesis.

- CT Scan: Provides better delineation of EMH lesions, which appear as soft tissue masses with central low attenuation.

- MRI: Can characterize the lesions further, showing different signal intensities corresponding to the various stages of hematopoiesis.

Localized EMH lesions can occur in various extramedullary sites, including the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and paraspinal regions. These findings are indicative of the underlying hematological disorder.

88. Pathophysiology of Pulmonary Embolism and Imaging Modalities (4+4+1+1 marks):

Pathophysiology (4 marks):

Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a blood clot, typically from deep vein thrombosis (DVT), travels to the pulmonary arteries. The pathophysiology involves:

- Clot Formation: Formation of a thrombus (clot) within a deep vein, often in the lower extremities.

- Embolization: Dislodgment of the thrombus, which then travels through the venous system to the pulmonary arteries.

- Vascular Obstruction: The embolus obstructs pulmonary blood flow, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and decreased oxygenation.

Imaging Modalities (4 marks):

Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing PE:

- CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA): The primary imaging modality for diagnosing PE. It provides high-resolution images of the pulmonary arteries, showing filling defects caused by emboli.

- Ventilation-Perfusion (V/Q) Scan: Used when CTPA is contraindicated or inconclusive. It assesses lung ventilation and perfusion and can identify mismatched defects.

- Chest X-ray (1 mark): Often the initial imaging study, which may be normal or show non-specific findings such as atelectasis, pleural effusion, or Hampton's hump (a peripheral opacity).

- MRI (1 mark): Can be used in select cases but is less common than CTPA for PE diagnosis.

89. Differentiating a Mediastinal Mass from an Intrapulmonary Mass, Localization, and Differential Diagnosis of Anterior Mediastinal Lesions (2+3+5 marks):

Differentiating a Mediastinal Mass from an Intrapulmonary Mass (2 marks):

- On imaging, a mediastinal mass is typically located within the mediastinum, which can be seen as a central structure on imaging studies.

- In contrast, an intrapulmonary mass arises from the lung parenchyma and will be surrounded by lung tissue.

Localizing the Compartment of a Mediastinal Lesion (3 marks):

Mediastinal lesions can be categorized based on their location within the mediastinum:

1. Anterior Compartment: Lies in the anterior mediastinum, anterior to the heart and great vessels.

2. Middle Compartment: Located between the anterior and posterior compartments.

3. Posterior Compartment: Found in the posterior mediastinum, posterior to the heart.

Differential Diagnosis of Anterior Mediastinal Lesions (5 marks):

Common lesions in the anterior mediastinum include:

- Thymoma: A benign or malignant tumor of the thymus.

- Teratoma: A germ cell tumor that can contain various tissue types.

- Lymphoma: A lymphatic malignancy.

- Thyroid Lesions: Ectopic thyroid tissue or thyroid neoplasms.

- Lymph Node Enlargement: Reactive or metastatic lymphadenopathy.

Each of these lesions can have characteristic imaging features, such as thymic epithelial tumors appearing as well-defined masses in the thymus, teratomas containing fat and calcifications, lymphomas showing homogeneous enhancement,

and thyroid lesions demonstrating features consistent with thyroid tissue. A thorough clinical evaluation and additional imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, are often needed for a definitive diagnosis.

90. Evaluation of a Patient with Hemoptysis and a Cavitating Pulmonary Mass (8+2 marks):

A 65-year-old chronic smoker presenting with hemoptysis and a cavitating intrapulmonary mass with spiculated margins in the left upper zone on chest radiograph requires a comprehensive evaluation to determine the extent of disease and operability. Here's how I would approach this case:

Further Evaluation (8 marks):

1. Clinical Assessment: Begin with a thorough clinical evaluation, including the patient's history, smoking history, associated symptoms, and physical examination.

2. Chest CT Scan: Perform a contrast-enhanced chest CT scan, which is the gold standard for evaluating intrathoracic lesions. CT provides detailed information about the size, location, extent, and characteristics of the lesion.

3. Bronchoscopy: Consider a bronchoscopy to evaluate the airway and assess for endobronchial lesions or bleeding sources. It can help determine if the lesion is operable.

4. PET-CT (if indicated): In some cases, a PET-CT scan may be performed to assess the metabolic activity of the lesion, detect distant metastases, and assist in staging.

5. Histopathological Evaluation: A biopsy, either transthoracic needle biopsy or bronchoscopic biopsy, is crucial to establish a histopathological diagnosis. This helps differentiate between benign and malignant lesions.

Determining Operability (2 marks):

To decide if the lesion is operable, the following signs and considerations would be crucial:

1. Extent of Disease: Evaluate the extent of local invasion and presence of lymph node involvement on CT and PET-CT.

2. Histopathology: Review the biopsy results to confirm the nature of the lesion (benign or malignant). Malignant lesions may be considered for surgery, depending on staging.

3. Performance Status: Assess the patient's overall health, comorbidities, and functional status. Patients should be able to tolerate surgery.

4. Absence of Distant Metastases: Ensure that there are no distant metastases detected on imaging studies.

5. Resectability: Assess whether surgical resection is feasible based on the tumor location, size, and involvement of critical structures.

Ultimately, the decision for surgery would involve a multidisciplinary approach, including input from pulmonologists, oncologists, and thoracic surgeons. Operability would depend on factors such as tumor staging, patient suitability for surgery, and potential for curative resection.

91. Changes in Chest Radiograph in Collapse of Different Lobes in Both Lungs (10 marks):

The radiographic appearance of lobar collapse in both lungs can vary depending on the lobe affected and the underlying cause. Here are the typical changes seen on a chest radiograph for collapse of different lobes:

1. Right Upper Lobe (RUL) Collapse:

- On the affected side, the superior mediastinal border becomes elevated (opacified), giving the appearance of a raised horizontal fissure.

- The minor fissure, separating the RUL from the right middle lobe, may also become more prominent.

- The RUL itself may appear smaller and airless.

2. Right Middle Lobe (RML) Collapse:

- On the affected side, the right heart border may become more sharply defined and elevated.

- The minor fissure may be displaced superiorly.

- The RML collapses centrally and may appear triangular or wedge-shaped.

3. Right Lower Lobe (RLL) Collapse:

- The affected side may show loss of volume in the lower lung field.

- The horizontal fissure becomes more horizontal due to the lower lobe's collapse.

- The right hemidiaphragm may appear elevated.

- The right heart border may shift toward the affected side.

4. Left Upper Lobe (LUL) Collapse:

- On the affected side, the aortic arch and descending aorta may be more visible.

- The left heart border may shift toward the affected side.

- The LUL itself collapses centrally and may appear as a triangular opacity.

5. Left Lower Lobe (LLL) Collapse:

- The affected side may show opacification and loss of volume in the lower lung field.

- The left hemidiaphragm may appear elevated.

- The left heart border and aortic arch may become more prominent on the affected side.

The appearance of these changes on a chest radiograph can provide clues about the lobe involved and the underlying cause of collapse, which may include obstructive etiologies (e.g., tumor, foreign body, mucus plugging) or non-obstructive causes (e.g., atelectasis due to surfactant deficiency). Further evaluation with CT imaging and clinical correlation is often necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

92. Radiological Findings in Sequestration of Lung and Pulmonary Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy (5+5 marks):

a) Sequestration of Lung (5 marks):

- Definition: Pulmonary sequestration is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by a non-functioning lung tissue mass that lacks communication with the tracheobronchial tree and receives its blood supply from systemic arteries.

- Imaging Findings: On imaging studies (CT or MRI), sequestration may present as:

- A well-defined soft tissue mass, often located in the lower lobes of the lung.

- Aberrant systemic arteries supplying the lesion, typically arising from the descending aorta.

- Absence of bronchial communication with the normal airway.

- Adjacent lung atelectasis or consolidation due to non-functional lung tissue.

b) Pulmonary Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy (5 marks):

- Definition: Pulmonary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is a paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by clubbing of the fingers and toes, joint pain, and periostitis. It is often associated with underlying lung malignancies.

- Imaging Findings: Radiological findings may include:

- Soft tissue swelling around the periosteal regions, especially affecting the long bones, and is visible on radiographs.

- "Laminated" or "onion skin" periosteal reaction, particularly in the diaphyses of long bones.

- Joint effusions or synovial hypertrophy.

- Enlargement and obliteration of the vascular markings in the fingers and toes on plain radiographs due to clubbing.

These imaging findings in pulmonary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy should prompt further investigation for an underlying lung malignancy, which is often the primary cause.

93. Solitary Pulmonary Nodule (SPN): Definition, Causes, and Radiological Workup (1+2+7 marks):

Definition (1 mark):

A solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) is a discrete, well-circumscribed, and rounded lesion that measures less than 3 centimeters in diameter and is completely surrounded by lung parenchyma, without associated atelectasis, pneumonia, or lymphadenopathy.

Causes (2 marks):

SPNs can have various underlying causes, including:

1. Benign Lesions: Non-cancerous causes like granulomas (tuberculoma, histoplasmosis), hamartomas, or infectious nodules.

2. Malignant Lesions: Lung cancer, including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and metastases from extrapulmonary malignancies.

3. Inflammatory Lesions: Infections such as fungal infections, bacterial abscesses, or inflammatory pseudotumors.

4. Vascular Lesions: Pulmonary infarcts or arteriovenous malformations.

5. Rheumatologic Diseases: Rheumatoid nodules in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Radiological Workup of Solitary Pulmonary Nodule (7 marks):

When encountering an SPN on imaging, a systematic radiological workup is essential to differentiate between benign and malignant nodules:

1. Characteristics on Imaging:

- Size: Measure the nodule's size. Nodules smaller than 6 mm are less likely to be malignant, while those larger than 8 mm are more concerning.

- Density: Evaluate nodule density on CT. Ground-glass opacities or partially solid nodules are more likely to be malignant.

- Growth Rate: Assess nodule stability or growth over time with serial imaging. Rapid growth is suspicious for malignancy.

2. Clinical History:

- Gather the patient's clinical history, including risk factors for lung cancer (smoking history, occupational exposures) and any relevant symptoms (e.g., cough, weight loss).

3. Calcifications:

- Pattern of Calcification: Benign nodules often exhibit benign patterns of calcification, such as popcorn (central), diffuse, or eccentric calcifications. Malignant nodules tend to have punctate or stippled calcifications.

- Lack of Calcification: Non-calcified or predominantly non-calcified nodules are more concerning for malignancy.

4. Margins and Shape:

- Spiculated or Irregular Margins: These are more commonly associated with malignancy.

- Smooth, Well-Circumscribed Margins: Suggestive of a benign nodule.

5. Dual-Energy CT (if available):

- Dual-energy CT can help characterize nodule composition, which can aid in differentiation.

- Malignant nodules may exhibit higher iodine content.

6. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan:

- PET can assess nodule metabolic activity. Malignant nodules often demonstrate increased uptake.

- False negatives can occur with small nodules or low-grade malignancies.

7. Biopsy or Follow-Up:

- If the risk of malignancy is high based on imaging features, consider biopsy (e.g., CT-guided needle biopsy) for histological diagnosis.

- For indeterminate nodules, serial imaging at intervals can help determine stability or growth.

It's essential to approach SPNs with a multidisciplinary team, including radiologists, pulmonologists, and oncologists, to determine the most appropriate management, which may include further imaging, biopsy, or surgical resection based on the likelihood of malignancy.

94. A 30-yr-old female patient presented with h/o cough and one episode of hemoptysis. Her chest radiograph showed a cavitatory lesion measuring 3 cm in left mid zone. Enumerate the possible causes. How will you proceed with radiological evaluation in this case? [2+8 June 14]

Possible Causes:

1. Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB): TB is a common cause of cavitary lung lesions, especially in endemic regions. It often presents with cough and hemoptysis.

2. Bacterial Pneumonia: Certain bacterial infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae, can lead to the formation of lung abscesses with cavitations.

3. Fungal Infections: Invasive fungal infections like aspergillosis or histoplasmosis may produce cavitary lesions in the lungs.

4. Lung Cancer: Particularly squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, can present with cavitary lesions, albeit less commonly.

5. Vasculitis: Conditions like Wegener's granulomatosis can cause cavitary lung lesions due to granulomatous inflammation and tissue necrosis.

6. Lung Abscess: Non-infectious causes such as ischemic infarction or necrotic tumor can result in cavities within the lung.

7. Cystic Bronchiectasis: Chronic inflammation in the bronchial tubes can lead to the formation of cystic spaces.

8. Necrotizing Pneumonia: A severe form of bacterial pneumonia with necrosis of lung tissue can result in cavities.

Radiological Evaluation:

The radiological evaluation of this patient should be comprehensive and include the following steps:

1. High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) of the Chest: HRCT is essential for a detailed assessment of the cavitary lesion. It provides information about the size, location, and characteristics of the cavity, such as thickness of the cavity wall, the presence of air-fluid levels, and surrounding lung parenchyma. This can help differentiate between infectious and non-infectious causes.

2. Sputum Analysis: Collecting and analyzing sputum for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and culture is crucial to rule out pulmonary TB. Other microbiological tests, such as bacterial cultures or fungal smears, may be indicated based on clinical suspicion.

3. Bronchoscopy: In cases where the diagnosis remains uncertain, a bronchoscopy can be performed to obtain samples from the lesion for histopathological examination and to rule out endobronchial lesions.

4. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan: If malignancy is suspected, a PET scan may be considered to assess the metabolic activity of the lesion and detect distant metastases.

5. Biopsy: A percutaneous needle biopsy or surgical lung biopsy may be necessary if other investigations do not yield a definitive diagnosis, especially in cases of suspected malignancy or atypical infections.

6. Follow-Up Imaging: Serial chest radiographs or CT scans may be required to monitor the progress of treatment and assess resolution or progression of the lesion.

In summary, the approach to evaluating a cavitatory lung lesion involves a systematic assessment combining clinical history, radiological imaging (especially HRCT), microbiological testing, and, if necessary, invasive procedures such as bronchoscopy or biopsy. The specific diagnostic approach should be tailored to the individual patient's clinical presentation and risk factors.

95. Name the anatomical structures which contribute to the hilar shadow seen on a frontal chest radiograph. Enumerate the causes of unilateral large hilum in a 50 yr old male. Describe the imaging findings in any 2 pathological causes. [2+2+3+3 June 14]

The hilar shadow on a frontal chest radiograph is primarily formed by anatomical structures in the region of the pulmonary hilum. These structures include:

1. Main Pulmonary Artery: This large vessel carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs for oxygenation. It typically forms the lower portion of the hilar shadow.

2. Pulmonary Veins: Pulmonary veins, which carry oxygenated blood from the lungs back to the left atrium of the heart, contribute to the hilar shadow. They are typically seen as thinner structures compared to the main pulmonary artery.

3. Bronchi: The bronchi, which are the airways leading into the lungs, also contribute to the hilar shadow. They appear as branching structures extending from the central hilum.

Causes of Unilateral Large Hilum in a 50-year-old Male:

1. Enlarged Lymph Nodes: Lymphadenopathy is a common cause of a unilateral large hilum. It can result from various conditions such as infection (e.g., tuberculosis or fungal infections), malignancy (e.g., lung cancer or lymphoma), or inflammatory diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis).

2. Pulmonary Artery Aneurysm: An aneurysm of the pulmonary artery can lead to an enlargement of the hilar shadow, especially on the side where the aneurysm is located.

Imaging Findings in Two Pathological Causes:

Enlarged Lymph Nodes (e.g., due to Tuberculosis):

- Radiographic Appearance: On a chest radiograph, there may be an increase in the size and density of hilar lymph nodes, causing an enlargement of the hilar shadow unilaterally.

- CT Findings: CT scans can provide a more detailed evaluation, showing round or oval-shaped lymph nodes with central necrosis (caseating granulomas) and calcifications in the case of tuberculosis.

Pulmonary Artery Aneurysm:

- Radiographic Appearance: On a chest radiograph, a unilateral hilar enlargement may be seen, often with a rounded or bulging contour at the hilum.

- CT Findings: CT angiography can demonstrate the dilated pulmonary artery segment, confirming the presence of an aneurysm. It may also reveal compression of adjacent structures by the aneurysm.

96. A 20-yr-old female with history of fever showed an anterior mediastinal and right hilar mass on chest radiograph. Enumerate the causes. Discuss the radiological finding which shall help you in formulating your differential diagnosis. Describe in brief features which are useful in differentiating Hodgkinâ€˜s disease and non-Hodgkinâ€˜s lymphoma. [2+6+2 June 14]

Causes of an anterior mediastinal and right hilar mass in a 20-year-old female could include:

1. Lymphoma: Both Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can present as mediastinal masses.

2. Thymoma: A tumor originating from the thymus gland.

3. Germ Cell Tumor: Such as a teratoma.

4. Sarcoidosis: Can cause lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum.

Radiological Finding for Formulating a Differential Diagnosis:

- The radiological finding that can help in formulating a differential diagnosis is the pattern of contrast enhancement on a contrast-enhanced CT scan. Different tumors and pathologies have characteristic enhancement patterns (e.g., homogeneous enhancement in thymomas, heterogeneous enhancement in lymphomas).

Distinguishing Features between Hodgkin's Disease and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma:

Hodgkin's Disease:

- Characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells.

- Typically has contiguous spread, involving lymph nodes in a predictable manner.

- Often presents with localized mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

- Bimodal age distribution with a peak in young adulthood and another in late adulthood.

Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma:

- Comprises a diverse group of lymphoproliferative disorders.

- Can involve lymph nodes in a non-contiguous, skip pattern.

- May not involve the mediastinum as frequently as Hodgkin's disease.

- No Reed-Sternberg cells are present.

In summary, the radiological evaluation of an anterior mediastinal and right hilar mass should include a contrast-enhanced CT scan to assess the enhancement pattern. Differential diagnosis should consider various tumors and conditions, with specific features aiding in distinguishing between Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

97. Describe the radiological anatomy of diaphragm. Enumerate various types of diaphragmatic hernias. Discuss the imaging findings in any two hernias which can be seen in a 40 yr old patient. [3+1+3+3 June 14]

Radiological Anatomy of Diaphragm:

The diaphragm is a dome-shaped, musculotendinous structure that separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities. It plays a crucial role in respiration. The radiological anatomy of the diaphragm can be described as follows:

1. Central Tendon: The diaphragm's central portion is a strong, avascular, tendinous structure known as the central tendon. On radiographs, this appears as a radiopaque curvilinear line, forming the highest point of the diaphragm's dome.

2. Muscular Diaphragm: The diaphragm's periphery consists of muscular fibers that originate from the xiphoid process, lower ribs, and vertebral bodies. These muscles converge toward the central tendon, forming the diaphragmatic dome. On radiographs, the muscular diaphragm is not as radiopaque as the central tendon and may appear relatively lucent.

3. Openings: The diaphragm has several natural openings for structures to pass between the thoracic and abdominal cavities. These include the aortic hiatus (for the aorta), esophageal hiatus (for the esophagus), and the caval opening (for the inferior vena cava).

Types of Diaphragmatic Hernias:

Diaphragmatic hernias are abnormal openings or defects in the diaphragm through which abdominal organs can herniate into the thoracic cavity. Various types of diaphragmatic hernias include:

1. Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH): This type is typically seen in infants and results from a failure in the diaphragm's formation during fetal development. Organs such as the stomach or intestines herniate into the chest.

2. Hiatal Hernia: Hiatal hernias involve the protrusion of the stomach into the thoracic cavity through the esophageal hiatus. It can be classified as sliding or paraesophageal, depending on the position of the gastroesophageal junction.

3. Traumatic Diaphragmatic Hernia: This results from trauma or injury to the diaphragm, often due to blunt or penetrating trauma. Herniation of abdominal organs into the chest can occur.

Imaging Findings in Two Diaphragmatic Hernias in a 40-Year-Old Patient:

Hiatal Hernia:

- Radiographic Findings: On a chest radiograph, a hiatal hernia may appear as a curvilinear or round opacity in the region of the lower thoracic esophagus. A barium swallow study may show the herniated stomach in the thoracic cavity.

Traumatic Diaphragmatic Hernia:

- Radiographic Findings: Traumatic hernias may be challenging to diagnose on radiographs alone. Suspicion arises when there is a history of trauma, and findings may include an elevated hemidiaphragm or visceral air-fluid levels in the thorax. Confirmation typically requires CT or fluoroscopy.

98. Enumerate causes of cystic mediastinal lesions. Describe imaging features of any 2 conditions. [2+4+4 Dec 14]

Causes of Cystic Mediastinal Lesions:

Cystic mediastinal lesions can have various etiologies, including:

1. Bronchogenic Cysts: Arise from remnants of the primitive foregut and contain bronchial elements.

2. Pericardial Cysts: Result from an abnormality during pericardial development.

3. Thymic Cysts: Develop from remnants of thymic tissue.

4. Neurogenic Cysts: Arise from neural elements.

5. Lymphangiomas: Comprise lymphatic tissue and cystic spaces.

6. Teratomas: Germ cell tumors with cystic components.

Imaging Features of Two Conditions:

Bronchogenic Cysts:

- Radiographic Appearance: On chest radiographs, bronchogenic cysts appear as well-defined, round or oval, lucent lesions in the mediastinum. They do not usually enhance with contrast on CT scans.

- CT Imaging: CT can provide detailed characterization, showing a fluid-filled cyst with thin walls and no enhancement. MRI can demonstrate high fluid signal intensity.

Pericardial Cysts:

- Radiographic Appearance: Pericardial cysts typically appear as well-defined, round or oval, lucent lesions in the cardiophrenic angle on chest radiographs.

- CT Imaging: On CT, these cysts are seen as fluid-filled structures with thin, smooth walls that do not enhance with contrast. They may have a "water-density" appearance.

99. a) Castlemanâ€˜s disease b) Role of Dual energy CT in pulmonary embolism. [5+5 Dec 14]

a) Castleman's Disease:

Castleman's disease is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the abnormal growth of lymphoid tissue. It can occur in various locations, including the mediastinum. Radiologically, it may present as a well-defined mediastinal mass on imaging studies, often with lymph node enlargement.

b) Role of Dual Energy CT in Pulmonary Embolism:

Dual Energy CT (DECT) is a valuable tool in evaluating pulmonary embolism (PE). It helps differentiate between clot material and other vascular or non-vascular structures in the pulmonary arteries. DECT can provide information on clot composition (e.g., fresh thrombus vs. chronic thrombus) and assess the degree of perfusion defects in the lungs, aiding in the diagnosis and characterization of PE.

100. Enumerate causes of solitary pulmonary nodules. Discuss the role of various newer imaging techniques in assessment of these lesions. [2+8 Dec 14]

Causes of Solitary Pulmonary Nodules:

Causes of solitary pulmonary nodules include benign and malignant conditions, such as granulomas, infections, primary lung cancer, metastases, and benign neoplasms.

Role of Various Newer Imaging Techniques:

Several advanced imaging techniques play a crucial role in the assessment of solitary pulmonary nodules:

1. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan: PET scans can help differentiate between benign and malignant nodules by assessing their metabolic activity. Malignant nodules typically exhibit increased metabolic activity.

2. CT Perfusion Imaging: This technique provides information on tissue perfusion and can help distinguish between benign and malignant nodules based on differences in blood flow.

3. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): MRI can provide detailed soft tissue characterization of pulmonary nodules, helping in the assessment of their vascularity and morphology.

4. Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI algorithms can assist in the characterization of solitary pulmonary nodules by analyzing various imaging features and providing predictive models for malignancy.

In summary, newer imaging techniques, such as PET scans, CT perfusion imaging, MRI, and AI, have improved our ability to evaluate solitary pulmonary nodules, aiding in their diagnosis and management.

101. Discuss various chest complications in a post-operative patient. Describe in detail imaging features in any two conditions. [4+3+3 Dec 14]

Chest Complications in a Post-Operative Patient:

Post-operative patients can experience various chest complications, which may include:

1. Atelectasis: Partial or complete collapse of a lung or a portion of it due to mucus plugging, decreased lung expansion, or compression.

2. Pneumonia: Infection of the lung tissue, often due to impaired cough reflex or intubation-related factors.

3. Pleural Effusion: Accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity, often due to surgical trauma or inflammation.

4. Pneumothorax: Air accumulation in the pleural space, which can result from barotrauma, chest tube insertion, or underlying lung disease.

5. Hemothorax: Accumulation of blood in the pleural space, typically due to vascular injury during surgery.

Imaging Features in Two Conditions:

Atelectasis:

- Imaging Features: Chest X-ray or CT may show volume loss in the affected lung or lobe, with increased opacity (consolidation) and mediastinal shift toward the atelectatic side. Air bronchograms may be visible within the collapsed lung.

Pleural Effusion:

- Imaging Features: Chest X-ray or CT can reveal a meniscus sign, which is a curved line representing the fluid level in the pleural cavity. On lateral views, a blunting of the costophrenic angle is often observed. Ultrasound can provide real-time visualization and guide fluid aspiration.

102. A 55 yr male patient presents with left opaque hemithorax. Enumerate the likely causes and discuss the imaging features in two common conditions. [2+4+4 Dec 14]

Causes of Left Opaque Hemithorax in a 55-Year-Old Male:

Various conditions can result in a left opaque hemithorax, including:

1. Pleural Effusion: Accumulation of fluid in the left pleural cavity.

2. Pneumonia: Infection causing consolidation of the left lung.

3. Lung Mass or Tumor: Such as lung cancer.

4. Atelectasis: Partial or complete collapse of the left lung.

5. Hemothorax: Accumulation of blood in the left pleural space.

Imaging Features in Two Common Conditions:

Pleural Effusion:

- Imaging Features: Chest X-ray or CT may show a complete or partial opacification of the left hemithorax with a meniscus-shaped fluid level. On lateral views, the costophrenic angle will appear blunted. Ultrasound can visualize the effusion and guide diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

Lung Mass or Tumor (e.g., Lung Cancer):

- Imaging Features: Chest X-ray or CT may reveal a well-defined or irregular opacity in the left lung. It may have associated features such as spiculations, cavitations, or lymphadenopathy. A contrast-enhanced CT can provide additional information on vascularity and staging.

103. Discuss various types of aortic aneurysms. Described various modalities to investigate such patients with advantages and disadvantages of each. Discuss briefly role of interventional procedure. [2+6+2 Dec 14]

Types of Aortic Aneurysms:

Aortic aneurysms can be classified into various types, including:

1. Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA): Involves the abdominal aorta.

2. Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm (TAA): Affects the thoracic aorta.

3. Aortic Dissection: A separation of the layers of the aortic wall.

4. Aortoiliac Aneurysm: Involves the aorta and iliac arteries.

Investigation Modalities and Their Advantages/Disadvantages:

1. CT Angiography (CTA):

- Advantages: Provides detailed anatomical information, including size, location, and involvement of branch vessels. It is the imaging modality of choice for aortic aneurysms.

- Disadvantages: Involves radiation exposure and iodinated contrast, which may be a concern for some patients.

2. Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA):

- Advantages: Radiation-free and provides excellent soft tissue contrast. Can be used in patients with contraindications to contrast agents.

- Disadvantages: May not be as readily available as CT, and some patients with claustrophobia may find it challenging.

3. Ultrasound (Doppler):

- Advantages: Non-invasive, widely available, and cost-effective for screening and follow-up.

- Disadvantages: Operator-dependent and limited by body habitus or bowel gas interference.

Role of Interventional Procedure:

Interventional procedures, such as endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), play a crucial role in the treatment of aortic aneurysms. EVAR involves the placement of a stent graft within the aneurysm to exclude it from the circulation, preventing rupture. It offers advantages such as reduced surgical morbidity, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery compared to open surgical repair. However, patient selection and follow-up imaging are critical for the success of these procedures.

104. a) Takayasuâ€˜s arteritis b) Role of RFA in chest tumors. [5+5 Dec 14]

a) Takayasu's Arteritis:

Takayasu's arteritis is a rare autoimmune disease that primarily affects large arteries, including the aorta and its branches. It can lead to stenosis, occlusion, and aneurysm formation. Imaging modalities such as CT angiography and magnetic resonance angiography are used for diagnosis and monitoring.

b) Role of Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) in Chest Tumors:

RFA is a minimally invasive technique used in the treatment of lung tumors. It involves the use of thermal energy delivered through a needle-like probe to destroy tumor cells. RFA is especially useful in cases where surgery is not an option, and it offers advantages such as shorter hospital stays, quicker recovery, and reduced morbidity compared to surgery. It can be used for both primary lung cancer and metastatic lesions in the lung.

105. Etiopathogenesis, clinical forms, complications and radiological features of silicosis. [June 15].

Silicosis: Etiopathogenesis, Clinical Forms, Complications, and Radiological Features

Etiopathogenesis:

Silicosis is a type of pneumoconiosis caused by inhalation of fine silica dust particles. These particles, primarily crystalline silica (quartz), are deposited in the lung tissue and trigger an inflammatory response, leading to fibrosis. Exposure to silica dust commonly occurs in industries like mining, construction, and sandblasting.

Clinical Forms:

1. Chronic Silicosis: This is the most common form, typically resulting from long-term, low-level exposure to silica. It presents with gradual onset of symptoms after several years of exposure.

2. Accelerated Silicosis: This form develops over a shorter period of high-intensity exposure to silica.

3. Acute Silicosis: Occurs due to intense, short-term exposure to very high levels of silica dust. Symptoms develop rapidly.

Complications:

1. Progressive Massive Fibrosis (PMF): A severe complication characterized by extensive fibrotic nodules in the lung, leading to significant respiratory impairment.

2. Tuberculosis (TB): Silicosis increases the risk of TB infection, as the damaged lung tissue becomes more susceptible to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

3. Lung Cancer: Silica exposure also raises the risk of lung cancer development.

Radiological Features:

- Chest X-ray: Common findings include small, rounded opacities predominantly in the upper lung zones. PMF appears as large, rounded opacities with a diameter exceeding 1 cm. Eggshell calcifications around lymph nodes may also be seen.

- CT Scan: CT can provide more detailed information, showing small nodules and larger areas of fibrosis. CT is especially useful for identifying PMF and complications such as TB or lung cancer.

106. a) Causes of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. b) Role of imaging in their differentiation. [June 2015]

a) Causes of Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy:

Mediastinal lymphadenopathy can be caused by various conditions, including infections (tuberculosis, histoplasmosis), malignancies (lymphoma, lung cancer), inflammatory diseases (sarcoidosis), and autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis).

b) Role of Imaging in Differentiation:

Imaging plays a crucial role in differentiating the causes of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. CT and PET-CT can help assess the size, shape, distribution, and metabolic activity of lymph nodes, aiding in the diagnosis. For example, tuberculosis often presents with calcified lymph nodes, while lymphoma may show hypermetabolic nodes on PET-CT.

107. An adult male presents with recurrent chest infections and a cavitating lung lesion in left lower zone in a chest radiograph. Discuss the differential diagnosis and imaging features in two most likely causes. [June 2015]

Differential Diagnosis of Cavitating Lung Lesion with Recurrent Infections:

1. Pulmonary Tuberculosis: Tuberculosis can lead to cavitary lung lesions, especially in the lower zones. It often presents with recurrent infections, cough, and weight loss.

2. Lung Abscess: Abscess formation can result from infection with bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae, leading to cavitary lesions.

3. Bronchogenic Carcinoma: Certain types of lung cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma, can present with cavitary lesions.

4. Fungal Infections: Fungal infections like aspergillosis or histoplasmosis can cause cavitary lung lesions, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.

Imaging Features in Two Likely Causes:

Pulmonary Tuberculosis:

- Radiological Features: Chest X-ray may show cavitary lesions, often in the upper lobes, with thick, irregular walls. CT can provide detailed information, showing cavities, necrosis, and associated lymphadenopathy.

Lung Abscess:

- Radiological Features: Chest X-ray may reveal a cavitary lesion with an air-fluid level. CT can demonstrate a thick-walled cavity with surrounding inflammation. Contrast-enhanced CT may reveal peripheral enhancement.

108. Causes of pleural masses and their imaging features. [June 2015]

Causes of Pleural Masses and Their Imaging Features:

1. Mesothelioma: Arises from pleural mesothelial cells due to asbestos exposure. Imaging shows pleural thickening, pleural masses, and pleural effusion.

2. Metastatic Tumors: Tumors originating elsewhere can metastasize to the pleura, forming pleural masses. Imaging features depend on the primary tumor type.

3. Benign Fibrous Tumors (e.g., Solitary Fibrous Tumor): Appear as well-defined pleural masses with variable enhancement on CT scans.

4. Empyema: Infected pleural effusion can lead to thickening and loculated collections within the pleura.

5. Pleural Hemangioma: Rare vascular tumors of the pleura, appearing as well-defined masses on imaging.

109. a) Anatomic location and patterns of diaphragmatic rupture. b) Role of imaging in its evaluation. [June 2015]

a) Anatomic Location and Patterns of Diaphragmatic Rupture:

Diaphragmatic rupture can occur in different locations, including the left hemidiaphragm, right hemidiaphragm, or central tendon. Patterns of rupture include:

- Bochdalek Hernia: Postero-lateral herniation through the left diaphragm, often congenital.

- Morgagni Hernia: Anterior herniation through the diaphragm, typically on the right side.

- Traumatic Rupture: Due to blunt or penetrating trauma, resulting in tears in various diaphragmatic regions.

b) Role of Imaging in Evaluation:

Imaging, especially CT scans, plays a critical role in diagnosing diaphragmatic rupture by demonstrating diaphragmatic discontinuity, herniation of abdominal organs into the thorax, and associated injuries to other structures. MRI can also provide valuable information, particularly in non-traumatic cases.

110. a) Enumerate pulmonary manifestations in patients with HIV. b) Chest X-ray and CT features in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. [3+(3+4) Dec 15]

a) Pulmonary Manifestations in Patients with HIV:

Pulmonary complications in HIV-infected individuals can include opportunistic infections (Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, tuberculosis), non-infectious conditions (lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis), and HIV-related lung diseases (HIV-associated pulmonary hypertension).

b) Chest X-ray and CT Features in Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia:

- Chest X-ray: Typically shows bilateral, diffuse, fine reticular or granular opacities, sometimes described as a "ground-glass" appearance.

- CT Scan: CT may reveal ground-glass opacities, often with a perihilar or diffuse distribution. Consolidation, cysts, and pneumothorax can also occur.

111. Radiological features of: a) McLeodâ€˜s Syndrome b) Vanishing Lung Syndrome c) Scimitar syndrome. [3+3+4 Dec 15]

Radiological Features of:

a) McLeod's Syndrome: This is a rare X-linked disorder affecting muscles and the nervous system. Radiological findings may include muscle atrophy, especially in the lower limbs, and signs of neurodegeneration.

b) Vanishing Lung Syndrome: This rare condition involves progressive loss of lung volume without apparent cause. Radiologically, it presents as severe lung hyperinflation with a marked decrease in lung density.

c) Scimitar Syndrome: A congenital heart defect where one or more pulmonary veins drain into the inferior vena cava. Radiologically, it shows anomalous pulmonary venous return and may

resemble a "scimitar" on imaging.

112. Pathophysiology, imaging features, complications and differential diagnosis of Respiratory Distress Syndrome of New born. [2+3+2+3 Dec 15]

Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) of Newborn: Pathophysiology, Imaging Features, Complications, and Differential Diagnosis

Pathophysiology:

RDS, also known as hyaline membrane disease, primarily affects premature infants due to inadequate lung development. It is characterized by a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant, which leads to decreased lung compliance, atelectasis, and impaired gas exchange.

Imaging Features:

- Chest X-ray: Initial findings include diffuse, fine granular opacities, classically described as "ground-glass" appearance. Over time, it progresses to a "reticular" pattern with air bronchograms.

- CT Scan: Not routinely used in neonates due to radiation concerns, but it can provide more detailed information about the extent of lung involvement.

Complications:

- Pneumothorax: Due to barotrauma.

- Pulmonary Hemorrhage: Can occur secondary to the fragile lung tissue.

- Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD): May develop in severe cases.

- Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA): Due to the infant's stress response.

- Intraventricular Hemorrhage (IVH): Common in preterm infants with RDS.

Differential Diagnosis:

Differential diagnosis includes other causes of neonatal respiratory distress, such as transient tachypnea of the newborn, meconium aspiration syndrome, and congenital pneumonia.

113. Role of CT and MRI in staging of lung cancer. [5+5 Dec 15] [Repeat from June 11]

Role of CT and MRI in Staging of Lung Cancer:

CT and MRI play essential roles in the staging of lung cancer:

- CT (Computed Tomography):

- Advantages: CT provides high-resolution images of the lungs and mediastinum, making it suitable for evaluating primary lung tumors, lymph node involvement, and distant metastases. It is often used for initial staging.

- Disadvantages: CT uses ionizing radiation, limiting its use in some populations, and may not provide detailed soft tissue characterization compared to MRI.

- MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):

- Advantages: MRI is excellent for evaluating soft tissue structures, making it valuable for assessing the chest wall, diaphragm, and mediastinal structures. It does not involve ionizing radiation.

- Disadvantages: MRI may be less sensitive than CT for detecting small lung nodules. It can be less well-tolerated by some patients due to the need for breath-holding and longer scan times.

114. a) Antenatal diagnosis of congenital. diaphragmatic hernia. b) Imaging findings in gestational trophoblastic disease. [5+5 Dec 15]

a) Antenatal Diagnosis of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH):

Antenatal diagnosis of CDH can be made using prenatal imaging techniques, including ultrasound and fetal MRI. On ultrasound, a diaphragmatic defect can be visualized, often in the left posterolateral region, with herniation of abdominal organs (typically the stomach) into the thorax. Fetal MRI can provide additional details.

b) Imaging Findings in Gestational Trophoblastic Disease:

Gestational trophoblastic disease encompasses a group of conditions, including molar pregnancies and choriocarcinomas. On imaging, findings may include a "snowstorm" appearance on ultrasound, characterized by multiple cystic spaces of varying sizes within the uterus. Elevated beta-hCG levels are typically seen.

115. a) Enumerate various pathologies which can be found in posterior mediastinum. b) Imaging findings of posterior medistinal tumors in children. [3+7 Apr 16]

a) Pathologies in the Posterior Mediastinum:

Pathologies in the posterior mediastinum can include neurogenic tumors (neurofibromas, schwannomas), lymphomas, esophageal lesions (achalasia, diverticula), and paravertebral abscesses.

b) Imaging Findings of Posterior Mediastinal Tumors in Children:

Imaging findings vary depending on the tumor type but may include:

- Neurogenic Tumors: Typically well-defined, lobulated masses that displace adjacent structures. Neuroblastomas may show calcifications.

- Lymphomas: Enlarged lymph nodes or a homogeneous soft tissue mass in the posterior mediastinum.

- Esophageal Lesions: Barium swallow may show narrowing or outpouchings of the esophagus.

- Paravertebral Abscesses: Loculated fluid collections adjacent to the vertebral bodies with surrounding soft tissue inflammation.

116. a) Chest radiographic findings of pulmonary edema. b) Radiological differences between cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. [6+4 Apr 16]

a) Chest Radiographic Findings of Pulmonary Edema:

Chest radiographic findings of pulmonary edema include:

- Bat's Wing Appearance: Bilateral diffuse opacities in the upper and middle lung zones.

- Kerley B Lines: Linear opacities perpendicular to the pleura, indicating interstitial edema.

- Cardiomegaly: Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.

- Pleural Effusions: Due to increased hydrostatic pressure, pleural effusions may develop.

b) Radiological Differences Between Cardiogenic and Non-Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema:

Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is typically associated with cardiomegaly and vascular redistribution (cephalization), where vessels in the upper lobes are more prominent. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, such as in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lacks cardiomegaly and vascular redistribution and often has a more diffuse ground-glass appearance on imaging.

117. a) Enumerate etiologies of diffuse cystic lesions of lung. b) Radiological findings in any two of them. [2+4+4 Apr 16]

a) Etiologies of Diffuse Cystic Lesions of the Lung:

Diffuse cystic lung lesions can be caused by various conditions, including:

1. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM): A rare lung disease characterized by the proliferation of smooth muscle cells, leading to cyst formation.

2. Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH): Involves the accumulation of Langerhans cells, leading to cystic changes in the lung.

3. Cystic Bronchiectasis: Resulting from chronic infections, such as cystic fibrosis or prior infections like tuberculosis.

4. Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia (PCP): An opportunistic infection that can cause diffuse cystic lesions in immunocompromised individuals.

b) Radiological Findings in Two of Them:

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM):

- Imaging Findings: CT typically shows numerous thin-walled cysts distributed throughout the lungs, often with normal lung tissue in between. Pneumothorax can be a complication.

Cystic Bronchiectasis (e.g., Cystic Fibrosis):

- Imaging Findings: CT may reveal cystic spaces in association with bronchiectasis, which appears as dilated, thick-walled bronchi. Mucus plugging can be seen within these bronchi.

118. a) Enumerate the causes of hemoptysis. b) Role of interventional radiology in its management. [2+8 Apr 16]

a) Causes of Hemoptysis:

Hemoptysis can have various causes, including:

1. Bronchitis: Inflammation of the bronchial tubes.

2. Bronchiectasis: Abnormal widening and scarring of the bronchi.

3. Lung Infections: Such as tuberculosis or pneumonia.

4. Lung Cancer: Malignant tumors in the lung.

5. Pulmonary Embolism: Blood clots in the pulmonary arteries.

6. Trauma: Injury to the chest or airway.

7. Vascular Lesions: Such as arteriovenous malformations or aneurysms.

8. Anticoagulant Use: Medications that interfere with blood clotting.

b) Role of Interventional Radiology in Hemoptysis Management:

Interventional radiology can play a crucial role in the management of hemoptysis, especially in cases where bleeding is severe or difficult to control surgically. Techniques such as bronchial artery embolization involve the selective occlusion of bleeding vessels using catheters and embolic agents. This minimally invasive procedure can effectively control hemoptysis and avoid the need for more extensive surgery.

119. Causes and imaging findings in a neonate presenting with respiratory distress. [10 Apr 16] (Repeat from Dec 15)

Causes and Imaging Findings in a Neonate Presenting with Respiratory Distress:

Common causes of respiratory distress in a neonate include:

1. Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS): Characterized by surfactant deficiency, with imaging showing a ground-glass appearance.

2. Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (TTN): Often associated with retained fetal lung fluid, with imaging showing perihilar streaking ("wet lung" appearance).

3. Meconium Aspiration Syndrome (MAS): Due to aspiration of meconium into the airways, with imaging showing patchy opacities and hyperinflation.

4. Pneumonia: Infection of the lungs, with imaging revealing infiltrates and consolidation.

5. Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH): A defect in the diaphragm, with imaging showing abdominal contents in the thoracic cavity.

The specific imaging findings depend on the underlying cause and can be assessed through chest X-rays or other imaging modalities.

120. a) Define solitary pulmonary nodule and enumerate its causes. b) Role of dynamic CT in the evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodule. [1+4+5 Apr 16]

a) Define Solitary Pulmonary Nodule and Enumerate Its Causes:

A solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) is a single, well-defined, rounded lesion in the lung that measures less than 3 centimeters in diameter. Causes of SPNs include:

1. Benign Lesions: Such as granulomas, hamartomas, or infectious nodules.

2. Malignant Tumors: Including primary lung cancer or metastases from other cancers.

3. Infectious Lesions: Fungal or bacterial infections.

4. Vascular Lesions: Pulmonary artery aneurysms or varices.

5. Inflammatory Lesions: Rheumatoid nodules or sarcoidosis.

b) Role of Dynamic CT in the Evaluation of Solitary Pulmonary Nodule:

Dynamic CT scans, including perfusion CT and contrast-enhanced CT, play a crucial role in characterizing SPNs. They help assess the vascularity of the nodule and can provide information about the likelihood of malignancy. Features such as rapid contrast enhancement, washout, and irregular margins may suggest malignancy. Dynamic CT aids in distinguishing between benign and malignant SPNs and helps guide further management decisions, including biopsy or surgical resection.
